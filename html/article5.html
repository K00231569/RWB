                        <h1>Asus ROG Strix B450-E Gaming</h1>
                        <p><span class="author">Author: Marek Czerniejewski     | 20/11/2018</span></p>                   
                        <p>
                            Asus has announced a new motherboard for the Ryzen line of processors, the Asus ROG Strix B450-E Gaming. This is aimed at consumers who have the newest AMD Ryzen CPUs and are looking for a high quality motherboard to complete their build. The new board supports up to 64 GB of RAM at a frequency of 3533 MHz, which is crazy high.
                        </p>
                        <p>Due to its’ price (around 150 Euro) it lacks some features such as an LCD diagnostic display or a power and reset button on the motherboard itself, however that is to be expected as such features are usually reserved for boards costing upwards of 200 Euro. This should not be a deal breaker as such features certainly are not a necessity and more of an addon that’s nice to have.</p>
                        <p>The new Strix motherboard certainly offers a lot for the money, including three PCIe x16 slots and one PCIe x1 slot. There are also two M2 slots and six 6 GB/s SATA slots, which should be more than enough for most people that are in the market for a gaming set up. Filling out the list of features there’s also an abundance of USB ports, including two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports up front, 2 USB 3.1 Gen and 4 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports out back, along with two USB 2.0 ports both at the front and back. There’s also a type C port on the back of the motherboard, which is pretty standard for a motherboard in 2018. A gaming component wouldn’t be complete without some flashy, shiny design, and this board doesn’t disappoint. It has LED elements which highlight certain areas, but not too much to make it look like your computer is on fire. Overall the Asus ROG Strix B450-E Gaming is a good motherboard, and a nice update for the Ryzen line of CPUs, and recent reviews have backed up this statement.</p>
