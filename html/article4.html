                        <h1>Intel Core i9 9980XE: A Look At The New King Of The Jungle</h1>
                        <p><span class="author">Author: Marek Czerniejewski | 20/11/2018</span></p>                   
                        <p>Intel has brought out their new generation processors that are replacing the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/28/intel-cpu-coffee-lake-8th-gen-price-specs-guide/">8th gen</a> line of CPUs from the blue giant. Usually, Intel follows a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/intel-tick-tock-model-general.html">tick-tock model</a> where, each year they’d either bring out a completely new architecture or a revised, improved version of the previous generation processors. So, every second year or so, new and exciting Intel CPUs that push the limits of what we thought was possible come out and everyone is happy. When I say it now, it feels like an old legend that has been forgotten by all but the most hardcore geeks. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Intel has been stuck in the “improvement” stage for quite a while (4 years???) and for whatever reason they just can’t bring out something brand new and exciting that redefines the tech industry like they used to. Well guess what. The blue giant got sick of all the complaints, bad press and pressure from their biggest competitor, AMD, and this year they decided enough is enough. I present to you…. The i9-9980XE. It is NOT a simple improvement over last gen, oh no! It is…. Exactly the same as last year’s top offering from Intel! Take that consumers who want something more powerful and energy efficient for a lower price!</p>
                        <p>Yes. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-cpu-10nm-earnings-amd,36967.html">Whatever is going on at Intel</a>, things have gotten so bad that now not only do they not improve on last year’s products to at least offer SOMETHING to consumers that are eager to spend their hard-earned money, but now they simply give you the EXACT same product that they had last year. All they do is change the name to make you think they’re actually doing something over at Intel HQ instead of making paper airplanes.</p>
                        <p>Now that my rant is over, I can go over the very few things they did change. The heat spreader is now fused to the CPU, which provides slightly better temperatures under load.  Along with this, the clocks have been increased which does improve the performance somewhat, although not by much. The increase in clock speeds however, also increases power consumption. Basically what you’re getting with the new 9980XE is a 7980XE that is slightly overclocked to provide a slight bump in performance. This hardly warrants a new generation now, does it? Intel needs to take a step back. Maybe even a few steps back. Instead of focusing on bringing out a new product each year in order to milk money from its’ fanbase, they should slow down and focus on their products or AMD will eat them alive.
                       </p>
                        <p> I will leave you with the full specification of the “new” i9-9980XE, just in case you’ve read this and for some strange reason thought “Oh, this looks like such a good product I should definitely get this”… Here you go:</p>
