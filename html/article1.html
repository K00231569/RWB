                        <h1>GTX 2060 Built On Turing Architecture</h1>
                        <p><span class="author">Author: Marek Czerniejewski     | 20/11/2018</span></p>                   
                        <p>It has been confirmed that the new GTX 2060 will be using the new 
                            <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/turing-architecture/">Turing</a> architecture instead of the now outdated Pascal that the previous generation Nvidia cards were based on. Generally, this would be a no brainer but with Nvidia introducing their new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing">Ray Tracing</a> technology in the new top of the range line up things got a bit mixed up. The 2070 and 2080/Ti cards have gone away with the GTX branding and are now called RTX, as they are using Ray Tracing to improve light rendering in games in real time. However, the cheaper cards, such as the 2060 are sticking with the GTX branding as they will not support Ray Tracing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, because of this people didn’t know which direction Nvidia was going to take with the mid range cards. It has happened before, where one of the big three (Nvidia, Intel, AMD) has brought out a new generation of hardware and included some previous gen cards/CPUs that were simply rebranded. One such example is way back in 2013 where the new GTX 770 was actually a GTX 680 with slightly higher clock speeds and lowered price.
                            However, during a press conference the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang has eroded all doubts and confirmed that the more affordable, mainstream line up offering from Nvidia will also be based on the new architecture called Turing. The new architecture offers better performance and lower power drain for a lower price, but the price has not been confirmed yet.
